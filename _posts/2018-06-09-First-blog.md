# To record my research

	This is how to write your own blog. First, go to github account:
> account name:  my email at IC
> password: me

    Then go to "qdldqqiao.github.io" and open "_posts" and creat a new file with this form: year-month-day-Name, for example "2018-06-09-Blog"

    In this file, use the format of "Markdown" (It's quit easy) to record your research.
